A software developer at heart, located in Norway with a passion for programming and software architecture.
Experience with web backend development, frameworks/APIs, low-level programming (C/Assembly), tools, GUI applications, DevOps, Docker and Kubernetes.
May also dabble with frontend development if needed.

Worked as chief software engineer for [eZ systems](https://ez.no), a core developer at [Opera Software](https://opera.com) and
as senior software developer at [Aplia](https://aplia.no), currently
working as tech lead/senior software developer at [Cemit](https://cemit.com).

Spends some of my spare time playing video games (currently working my way through Baldurs Gate 3), working on my home servers (ZFS, Proxmox/Xen virtualization and docker containers/kubernetes),
or having fun tinkering with Amiga computers ðŸ˜„.
