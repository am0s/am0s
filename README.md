A software developer at heart, located in Norway with a passion for programming and software architecture.

Spends some of my spare time playing video games (currently revisiting Prey and Divinity Original Sin), working on my home servers (ZFS, Xen virtualization and docker containers),
or having fun tinkering with Amiga computers ðŸ˜„.
